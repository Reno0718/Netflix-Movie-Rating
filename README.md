## Project Title
**Netflix Movie Rating**

## Background
The popularity of Netflix has soared in recent years, making it one of the most famous movie streaming sites. The evaluation of a movie can be influenced by a person’s personality, the genre he or she pursues, the environment in which he or she has grown, and various factors. Ratings, specifically, present an essential standard for the audiences when evaluating different movies, and also they can help the audiences compare and choose the best movies. 

Our project utilizes the data of Netflix’s movie ratings from IMDb to analyze the relationship among the ratings, released year, durations, and genres. 


## Research Questions
- Is there a relationship between star ratings and durations (in minutes)?
- How does each feature (country, genre, age rating, duration, or year released) impact the star ratings of movies?
- Is there any difference in average star ratings between the recent movies (released before 2018) and the new movies (released after 2018)?
